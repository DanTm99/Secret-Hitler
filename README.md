What is Secret Spies?
----------------------------
Welcome to pre-WWII Germany. In Secret Spies, players German politicians attempting to hold a fragile Liberal government together and stem the rising tide of fascism. Watch out though - there are fascists among you, and someone is Hitler.

At the beginning of the game, each player is secretly assigned to one of three roles: Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. Hitler plays for the fascist team, and the fascists know who Hitler is, but most of the time Hitler does not know who his fellow fascists are. The Liberals don’t know who anyone is. The liberals win by enacting five liberal policies or killing Hitler. The fascists win by enacting six fascist policies, or if Hitler is elected chancellor late in the game. As Fascist policies are enacted, the government becomes more powerful and the President gains new powers. Even liberal players
may find themselves tempted to enact fascist policies that help them control the table and assassinate their enemies.
